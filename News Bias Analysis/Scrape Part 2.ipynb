      "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris remain effectively tied even after three of the most tumultuous months in recent American political history.Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n",
      "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are locked in a dead heat for the popular vote, 48 per cent to 48 per cent, the final national poll by The New York Times and Siena College has found, as the Vice-President struggles for an edge over the former president with an electorate that seems impossibly and immovably divided.\n",
      "The result, coming less than two weeks before Election Day, and as millions of Americans have already voted, is not encouraging for Harris. In recent elections, Democrats have had an edge in the popular vote even when they have lost the Electoral College and thus the White House. They have been looking to Harris to build a strong national lead as a sign that she would do well in such critical swing states as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n",
      "Harris and Trump remain effectively tied even after three of the most tumultuous months in recent American political history. A high-profile debate, two attempts on Trump’s life, dozens of rallies across seven battlefield states and hundreds of millions spent on advertisements have seemingly done little to change the trajectory of the race.\n",
      "Harris’ position, if anything, may have declined among likely voters since the last Times/Siena College poll, taken early this month. At the time, she had a slight lead over Trump, 49 per cent to 46 per cent. The change is within the margin of error, but the Times’ national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks as well, suggesting at the very least that this contest has drawn even closer.\n",
      "Although this latest Times/Siena College poll offers a glimpse into national sentiment, the presidential election will be decided in the seven battleground states where Harris and Trump have devoted the overwhelming amount of their time and resources. Most polls in those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin – suggest the contest is equally close.\n",
      "There are glimmers of hope in this final national poll for both Trump and Harris. For Trump, it is immigration: Fifteen per cent of respondents named immigration as their top issue, up from 12 per cent.\n",
      "Trump has hammered Harris on the Biden administration’s record on the issue – he has pledged to undertake “the largest deportation in American history” – as a closing message in his campaign speeches and advertisements. Voters by an 11-point margin said they trusted Trump more than Harris to deal with immigration.\n",
      "“I’m sorry, I do not agree with the illegals and the refugees coming in the country,” said Sandra Remiker, 51, a Republican from Barron, Wisconsin, who said she was planning to vote for Trump. She added: “I mean, if we can’t help our own people, our own veterans that are living on the streets, we shouldn’t be helping other countries.”\n",
      "And voters continue to be pessimistic about the direction of the country, a measure that historically has been a danger sign for the party in power. Just 28 per cent of respondents said the country was heading in the right direction. Trump has repeatedly painted a dark picture of the nation under President Joe Biden and Harris.\n",
      "The percentage of Americans who said that Trump, 78, is too old to be president remained at 41 per cent, essentially unchanged from July even after a series of rambling campaign speeches and appearances led to a swell of questions, including direct criticism from Harris, about the former president’s mental acuity and fitness.\n",
      "The poll included some encouraging signs for Harris. She has narrowed the gap with Trump on the economy, which remains the top issue for voters. Trump had a 13-point edge over Harris on which candidate could better manage the economy in the poll last month. That has shrunk to 6 points.\n",
      "This latest poll, as most of the polls done by Times/Siena over the past three months, is evidence of a U.S. electorate that is both polarized and frozen.The New York Times News Service\n",
      "“She does have a little bit more experience in the government at least,” said Luis Mata, an independent in San Antonio who said he changed his mind and decided to support Harris after watching her debate with Trump. “I know Donald Trump was our president for one term, but, before that, I don’t think he really had too much experience aside from being a businessman.”\n",
      "Harris also has a 16-point lead over Trump on which candidate would do a better job in protecting abortion access, a central theme of her campaign, as she seeks to build up support among female voters.\n",
      "And Harris still has room to grow. About 15 per cent of voters described themselves as not fully decided, and Harris is leading with that group, 42 per cent to 32 per cent. Two weeks ago, Trump had a minute edge with undecided or persuadable voters, 36 per cent to 35 per cent.\n",
      "“Both are not great candidates, and I’m on the fence if I’m going to vote at all – I don’t like either of them,” said Christopher Morgan, 33, an independent from Atlanta. But, he added: “If I had to, I’d probably vote for Kamala Harris. I don’t like Trump because I feel like he violated democracy. He should be accountable for what happened on Jan. 6.”\n",
      "The poll found that the 9 per cent of Americans who said they already had voted leaned heavily toward Harris, 59 per cent to 40 per cent. That is consistent with the advantage Democrats have historically had in early voting and mail voting, although there are signs this year that Republicans, unlike in 2020, are casting early ballots in unusually heavy numbers.\n",
      "This latest poll, as most of the polls done by Times/Siena over the past three months, is evidence of an electorate that is both polarized and frozen. There has been little change on some of the key questions used to measure voter sentiment.\n",
      "Harris was viewed favourably by 46 per cent of the electorate after Biden dropped out; she is seen favourably by 48% in this latest poll. Trump was viewed favourably by 47 per cent of respondents after Biden dropped out; he is now viewed favourably by 48% of respondents.\n",
      "The gender gap is as stark as ever. Harris leads Trump among women, 54 per cent to 42 per cent, while Trump leads Harris among men, 55 per cent to 41 per cent. There was essentially no change in those numbers over the course of this short contest.\n",
      "Larrissa Alexander, 27, a Republican in Atlanta, said she voted for Biden in 2020, but decided to oppose Harris this time because of the way Harris handled immigration as Biden’s vice president.\n",
      "“I was very, extremely disappointed in her response to our immigration issue,” she said. “And when she was first elected, that was one of the things that she was tasked with handling. And she accepted that responsibility. And then every time she was asked about it or pressed about it, it just was attitude-giving in return.”\n",
      "The poll found that voters are just as divided over congressional races as they are in the presidential race: Forty-eight per cent said they were planning to vote for a Republican for Congress in their district, while 48% said they would support a Democrat. The House, currently under narrow Republican control, is up for grabs in this election.\n",
      "This question is a rough measure of the fight for control; the question of which party controls the House of Representatives will come down to the outcome in a small number of swing congressional districts.\n",

      "The keys to the White House may be decided on the ground in Pennsylvania, where campaigns are blanketing the commonwealth, and the pivotal suburbs.Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Philadelphia suburbs this week as they vie for Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes, and the suburban residents who could prove crucial to their effort.“We just want to make sure that Kamala wins,” said Rosemary Moller. “Because the alternative is very frightening.”She and her husband, Jeffrey, added to the more than one million door knocks the campaign has completed in the state as volunteers canvass out of 50 campaign offices. They hit the pavement in Montgomery County, a region they too call home.“If you've judged by lawn signs, you'd have to say that, like, 99% of the lawns don't have a sign out at all, so you don't really know what's what's going on,” said Jeffrey Moller.“In our neighborhood,” Rosemary Moller added, “It's a little bit more Kamala than Trump.”The Harris-Walz campaign approaches Pennsylvania with go-everywhere tactics, but the suburbs are a significant target. They’re full throttle with organizing, phone calls and paid media, recognizing the need for significant margins in the suburbs to win Pennsylvania.\"You have to have significant margins in the suburbs. We will have significant margins in the suburbs. We've put in the work, not just on this campaign, but for years now, investing in county parties, investing in local races. We have excellent candidates for State House, State Senate seats there that are doing great work, and excellent members of Congress who are doing great work there. So we're all gas, no brakes on, boosting our margins in the suburbs as much as we can,” said Brendan McPhillipps, Senior Advisor for the Harris Campaign in Pennsylvania.In 2016, Hillary Clinton received 742,226 votes in the four counties surrounding Philadelphia. Trump ultimately won the state. But in 2020, President Joe Biden got 170,792 more, when he ultimately turned the state blue that year.RELATED STORY | Pennsylvania GOP group comes out with support for Harris-Walz ticketBut the campaign sees the suburbs as their own blue wall, and believes they are seeing enthusiasm in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia that will match 2020 levels.It believes they’re making progress in their suburban margins, in part contending Trump’s “extremism” is driving voters to them as they also focus on swaying Republicans, and make efforts in more historically red areas.“Our township isn't the well to do area that you might find elsewhere in Montgomery County, people trying to raise their kids and put their kids through school and so forth. So I think money is a big issue,” said Jeffrey Moller, adding he doesn’t believe it makes sense to connect higher prices to the Biden administration.The campaign is homing in on messages including Harris’ plan to combat price gouging, her healthcare policy, reproductive rights and around the issue of democracy.It believes they’re making progress in their suburban margins, according to a senior advisor for Pennsylvania, in part contending Trump’s “extremism” is driving voters to them as they also focus on swaying Republicans, and make efforts in more historically red areas.During the Republican primary, more than 19% of voters supported Nikki Haley over Trump in Bucks County, and nearly 25% of voters supported Nikki Haley over Trump in Montgomery County.\"Our campaign is closing out the final weeks by expanding, by going to more places, places that are good for our base, and places that are deep red counties,” said McPhillipps. “We're building a bigger tent and filling it up with supporters. And in the final weeks of a tight campaign, you want to be the campaign that is growing, not the campaign that's shrinking.\"“The coalition we have built has room for everyone who is ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump,” Harris said during a rally alongside Republicans who have endorsed her at Washington Crossing.But former president Donald Trump’s team has dismissed concerns over former Haley supporters backing Harris, as they zero in on issues like inflation, the economy and the border.“We win this great commonwealth, we are going to win the whole ball game,” Trump said during a town hall in Oaks, PA earlier this week, his first visit to the collar counties since the Republican National Convention.A campaign official described it as a battle of ideas, noting they are quadrupling down on the message ‘are you better off now than you were four years ago?’ in the counties surrounding Philadelphia.The official said they are “feeling good” about the counties, pointing to their ground game investments, the campaign having more than two dozen offices across the state, and Bucks County where slightly more Republicans than Democrats have registered to vote.That’s where Caroline Devenuto is volunteering, one of thousands across the state.“Definitely feeling confident because there's so much more visibility this election,” she said, who is volunteering as a “Trump Force 47” team captain this election.“I've never gotten money from anybody in my entire life, much less from the President of the United States. So during COVID, when, like, all of us single mothers were out here scrapping for money, like, you know, trying to make ends meet, that was the I was like, you know, he sees us. He cares about us.” she said.For each campaign, reaching women in the suburbs is a particular focus.“Well, I've always supported Trump. My biggest issue, as I mentioned, was immigration. I'm a first generation American. My parents immigrated to America legally and that's how it should be done, the way my parents came to this country,” said Vicky Wagner.She was part of a group of women that came together to see Trump at the town hall. For some, it was their first time seeing the former president, pointing to immigration, safety, affordability and foreign affairs as top concerns.“I know people that voted for him first and then the second election they did not in this election they're back. Women. So hopefully, you know, we're going to see a big change in that. I hope more women do come out,” said Colleen Rossi, noting she did consider other candidates but believes “he’s the only one that can get the job done” and plans to vote for him again.But polling has shown a historic gender divide, with women breaking for Harris in record numbers. Her campaign believes it has grown support among them, and on the trail has heavily focused on reproductive rights.“I’m a nurse, so you know, it might not be my choice, but even though I'm 68 years old, I still have a vote, and I can vote for my, you know, my nieces and other women I know,” said Rosemary Moller.With a race in battlegrounds that’s sure to be close, there are still challenges. Former Democratic Congresswoman Marjorie Margolies, the first woman to represent her suburban Philadelphia district in Congress, now teaches about women in politics at the University of Pennsylvania.“I still think that many, many, many people are more comfortable walking into the voting booth and voting for a White male. And that's what I said when on the when I went to Congress the first year of the woman, we knew that we were pushing the rock up the hill,” Margolies said.Now comes a push into the home stretch outside Philadelphia for each campaign, in the collar counties that could decide the presidency.RELATED STORY | Harris' interview with Fox News is marked by testy exchanges over immigration and more\n"
